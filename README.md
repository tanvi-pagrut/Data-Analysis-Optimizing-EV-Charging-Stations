# Data-Analysis-Optimizing-EV-Charging-Stations
Enhancing Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Project Overview This project, developed as a part of the 'Data Visualization' course, involves a comprehensive analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Stations using real-time usage and geographical data. The goal is to optimize the charging station infrastructure to improve user experience and expand the network's reach and efficiency.

Contents Both Jupyter notebook source code and tableau source code attached. Dirty dataset and cleaned dataset attached. Data year is from 2011 to 2013. Our final report has been attached. NetworkX: For constructing and analyzing complex networks of EV station usage patterns. Tableau: For creating interactive visualizations that provide insights into user distribution and behavior. Python: Used for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization with libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib. How to Use Network Analysis: Open Network_Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter or any IPython notebook environment to view and run the analysis. Tableau Dashboard: Load Tableau_Dashboard.twb into Tableau Desktop to interact with the dashboards. Ensure you have access to the underlying dataset, which may need to be linked upon opening. Report: Read Project_Report.pdf for a complete understanding of the project scope, methodologies applied, and the insights gained. Contributors Priya Govindarajulu, Raveena Kagne, Harsh Somaiya, Vaibhav Prakash Shete. Special thanks to the entire team for their dedication and hard work throughout this project.
